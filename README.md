# Tanuki Snowboard
A chaotic snowboarding game inspired by the Sonic Adventure series.

Grab some friends and some extra controllers, and race to the bottom of the course! jump off ramps to initiate tricks, and pull em off to gain a burst of speed forwards! You'll have to chain tricks to keep your speed up and take the lead!

Created using Godot, Blender, Paint.net, and Audacity.
